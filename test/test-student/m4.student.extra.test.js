    In this file, add your own test case that will confirm your correct implementation of the extra-credit functionality.
    You are left to decide what the complexity of each test case should be, but trivial test cases that abuse this flexibility might be subject to deductions.

    Imporant: Do not modify any of the test headers (i.e., the test('header', ...) part). Doing so will result in grading penalties.
