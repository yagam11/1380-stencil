      A common pattern in handling HTTP requests in Node.js is to have a
      subroutine that collects all the data chunks belonging to the same
      request. These chunks are aggregated into a body variable.

      When the req.on('end') event is emitted, it signifies that all data from
      the request has been received. Typically, this data is in the form of a
      string. To work with this data in a structured format, it is often parsed
      into a JSON object using JSON.parse(body), provided the data is in JSON
      format.

      Our nodes expect data in JSON format.
